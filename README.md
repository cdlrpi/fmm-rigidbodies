fmm-rigidbodies
===============

This repository is to develop the capability to model the charge distribution of rigid bodies in a temporally invariant way when expressed in the body-fixed basis.  Furthermore, the parametrization of the charge will allow conversion to the newtonian basis by a rotation operator.
